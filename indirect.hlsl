Yes, both Fresnel and metallic properties play crucial roles in defining the intensity and appearance of reflections on a surface.

Role of Fresnel

The Fresnel effect determines how much light is reflected based on the angle between the view direction and the surface normal. Typically:

	•	At glancing angles (where the view is more parallel to the surface), reflections are stronger.
	•	At direct angles (where the view is perpendicular to the surface), reflections are weaker.

In a physically-based rendering (PBR) shader, Fresnel is applied to both the specular reflection from the environment and the reflection map. Fresnel helps to achieve more realistic reflections that change based on the viewing angle.

Role of Metallic

The metallic property defines how reflective a surface is:

	•	For dielectrics (non-metallic surfaces, where metallic = 0), reflections are generally weaker, and the base reflectance at normal incidence is a low value (typically F0 = 0.04).
	•	For metals (metallic = 1), the reflections are stronger and come from the actual albedo color, making the surface fully reflective.

The metallic factor should also influence the contribution of the reflection map. For metals, you would rely heavily on the reflection map and environment reflections for a highly reflective look. For dielectrics, the reflection is usually more subtle and requires less of the reflection map.

Example HLSL Code Update

Here’s how you could incorporate Fresnel and metallic properties into the combination of the GGX-based indirect lighting with the reflection map:

float3 ComputeIndirectLighting(float3 normal, float3 viewDir, float3 reflectionCoords)
{
    // Reflection vector for indirect specular lighting
    float3 reflection = reflect(-viewDir, normal);

    // Roughness and view angles for GGX LUT sampling
    float NdotV = max(dot(normal, viewDir), 0.0);
    float2 uv = float2(NdotV, roughness);

    // Sample GGX LUT for the specular BRDF factor
    float2 specularBRDF = GGXLUT.SampleLevel(samplerState, uv, 0).rg;

    // Sample the prefiltered environment map for indirect specular contribution
    float3 prefilteredColor = environmentMap.SampleLevel(samplerState, reflection, roughness * 8.0).rgb;
    
    // Fresnel-Schlick for angle-dependent reflection intensity
    float3 F = fresnelSchlick(NdotV, lerp(float3(0.04, 0.04, 0.04), albedo, metallic));

    // Combine Fresnel with specular BRDF and environment color
    float3 indirectSpecular = prefilteredColor * (F * specularBRDF.x + specularBRDF.y);

    // Sample Lambertian LUT for indirect diffuse lighting
    float3 irradiance = LambertianLUT.SampleLevel(samplerState, uv, 0).rgb;
    float3 indirectDiffuse = irradiance * albedo * (1.0 - metallic);

    // Sample the reflection map for additional reflective details
    float3 reflectionMapColor = reflectionMap.Sample(samplerState, reflectionCoords).rgb;

    // Blend reflection map with indirect specular based on Fresnel and roughness
    float3 finalReflection = lerp(indirectSpecular, reflectionMapColor, saturate(1.0 - roughness)) * F;

    // Combine diffuse and specular components
    return indirectDiffuse + finalReflection;
}

Explanation of Updates

	1.	Fresnel Calculation:
	•	The Fresnel term F is calculated using the Schlick approximation.
	•	It interpolates between a base reflectance (F0, often 0.04 for dielectrics) and the albedo color for metallic surfaces.
	2.	Reflection Map Contribution with Fresnel and Roughness:
	•	finalReflection blends indirectSpecular with reflectionMapColor based on roughness, then multiplies by F to scale the reflections by the Fresnel term.
	•	This combination ensures that at glancing angles, the reflections are stronger and influenced by the reflection map, while at direct angles, they are more subtle.
	3.	Metallic Factor for Diffuse:
	•	The indirectDiffuse term is scaled by (1.0 - metallic) to exclude diffuse lighting for metals, as metals don’t have diffuse reflections.

This setup lets Fresnel and metallic properties play meaningful roles in the final reflections, creating realistic material appearances for both metals and non-metals.
